I am a third-year undergraduate student at [Bits Pilani, Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Goa/). I am interested in Artificial Intelligence, Generative Models, and Deep Learning. I am a member of the [Society for Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning(SAIDL)](https://www.saidl.in/), where I actively contribute to open-source projects and participate in paper reading sessions. Currently I am working under [Prof. Tirtharaj Dash](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/tirtharaj/profile) on Bayesian Deep Learning.

I listen to Carnatic instrumental music and play badminton!
