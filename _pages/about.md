I am an alumnus of [Bits Pilani, Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Goa/) and currently working at [minus zero](https://minuszero.ai/). I actively contribute to open-source projects (checkout [Vformer](github.com/sforAiDl/vformer) and [pytorch blogpost](https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch-1.12-new-library-releases/#new-augmentations-layers-and-losses)). 

I love to play badminton and listen to Carnatic Instrumental music. I occasionally roam in the nearby jungles, climb trees and I have keen interest in Bird Watching.
