### GSOC @TVB

Project Description: 

 
  The Virtual Brain (TVB) is a scientific simulation platform that provides all
means to generate, manipulate and visualize connectivity and network dynamics
of the brain networks. Researchers in Computational Neuroscience use brain
network models to understand the dynamic behavior of the healthy and diseased
brain, as measured by various neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI, EEG, and
MEG. TVB is currently the only neuroinformatics project providing a platform for
researchers to work together on modeling studies using brain network models
with realistic connectivity. 

  The modeling of the simulations requires datasets generally hosted on
data storage platforms like Zenodo, OpenSourceBrain, EBRAINS, etc. One has
to download the dataset manually, unzip it and then use it inside the web GUI.


  Instead of manually downloading and unzipping the data, the project's goal
is to have a dedicated framework to manage the downloading and unzipping the
dataset from remote sources. Right now, we are focusing on the Zenodo
platform
